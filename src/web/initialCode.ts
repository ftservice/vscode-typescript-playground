// which gives you a chance to write, share and learn TypeScript.

// You could think of it in three ways:
//
//  - A location to learn TypeScript where nothing can break
//  - A place to experiment with TypeScript syntax, and share the URLs with others
//  - A sandbox to experiment with different compiler features of TypeScript

const anExampleVariable = "Hello World"

// This is still very much a work in progress. You can drag the TypeScript logo from the left activity bar 
// to the right are if you would like to have a three pane interface.
